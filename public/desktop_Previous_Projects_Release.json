{"data": "---\ntitle: Kali Linux 2020.1 Release\ndate: 2020-01-29 21:26:00\ntags:\n- Linux\n- Kali\n- 2020\n- Vmware\n- iso\n- system\n---\nali as your Main OS\nSo with this, should you use Kali as your daily driver, as the primary OS? It\u2019s up to you.\nThere wasn\u2019t anything really stopping you before, we just don\u2019t encourage it. We still don\u2019t. But its a helping hand for the people who are familiar with Kali enough.\n\nWhy do we not recommend it?\nBecause we are unable to test for that usage pattern and we don\u2019t want the influx of bug reports that would come with it.\nIf you are brave enough to try it, you may wish to switch the branch from \u201crolling\u201d to \u201ckali-last-snapshot\u201d to try and be more stable.\n\nKali Single Installer Image\nWe took a good hard look at the usage of Kali, what images are actually downloaded, how they are put to use, and so on. With this information in hand, we decided to completely restructure and simplify the images we release. Going forward, we will have an installer image, a live image, and a network installer image.\n\nThese changes should allow for easier selection of the right image for you to download, while increasing flexibility on installation and further reducing download sizes.\n\nOur Installer Image\n\nThis is what we recommend for most users that want to install Kali on their system\nDoesn\u2019t require a network connection (aka offline install) for the default package selection\nAble to select desktop environment to install (Previously there was a separate image for each DE: XFCE, GNOME, KDE, etc.)\nAble to select tools to install at install time\nCan\u2019t be used to boot a live system. This is just an installer image.\nFilename:\nkali-linux-2020.1-installer-<amd64|i386>.iso\nWe are no longer offering separate images for every desktop environment (DE). Instead, we now have a single image with the option to pick your DE during installation. This means there isn\u2019t a download link for Xfce (which is our default option since 2019.4), GNOME, KDE, MATE or LXDE DEs. Just one image to rule them all.\n\nAt install time, you may select the tools included with Kali (or none at all)! This gives you more control over what you want. We understand that Kali comes with more tools than some people use, or they have their own select tools they use. Now they can install Kali without any metapackages, giving them a bare Kali installation, so they can individually select what tools they want (rather than groups).\n\nThe default image contains the kali-desktop-xfce and kali-tools-default packages, allowing for an offline installation of Kali (as it always has been). Selecting any non-default tools will require a network connection.\n\nNote: \u201cKali Live\u201d is not included in this image. If you wish to use live mode, you\u2019ll need the live image.\n\nKali Setup Screen\n\nNetwork Install Image\n\nSmallest image to download\nThis requires a network connection to install\nDuring setup, it will download the latest packages every time it\u2019s used\nAble to select desktop environment to install\nAble to select tools to install\nCan\u2019t be used to boot a live system. This is just an installer image.\nFilename:\nkali-linux-2020.1-installer-netinst-<amd64|i386>.iso\nIt\u2019s a very small image, containing only enough to install the base system, but behaving exactly like the full installer image, allowing you to install everything that Kali offers, provided that you have enabled network connectivity.\n\nLive Image\n\nIts primary use is to be able to run Kali, without installing it\nBut it also contains an installer, behaving like the \u201cNetwork Install Image\u201d described above\nFilename:\nkali-linux-2020.1-live-<amd64|i386>.iso\n\u201cKali Live\u201d hasn\u2019t been forgotten about \u2013 it\u2019s just moved to its own image. This allows you to try Kali without installing it and is perfect for running off a USB stick. You can install from this image, however, it will require a network connection (this is why we suggest the stand-alone install image for most users).\n\nAlternatively, you can generate your own image, in particular if you want to use another desktop environment instead of our default Xfce. It\u2019s not as hard as it sounds!.\n\nARM Images\nYou will probably notice a bit of a change in the ARM images starting with our 2020.1 release. There are fewer images available for download, due to both manpower and hardware constraints, some images won\u2019t be posted without community assistance.\nThe scripts are still updated, so if an image doesn\u2019t exist for a machine you use, you will have to create it by running the build script on a Kali machine.\n\nARM images for 2020.1 will still run as root by default.\n\nThe sad news that a lot of people didn\u2019t want to hear\u2026 an image for the Pinebook Pro isn\u2019t included in the 2020.1 release. We are still working on getting it added, and as soon as it is ready we will post it.\n\nNetHunter Images\nOur mobile pen-testing platform, Kali NetHunter, has also had some new improvements. You are now no longer required to root your phone in order to run Kali NetHunter, but that does come with some limitations.\n\nTo suit everybody\u2019s needs, Kali NetHunter now comes in the following three editions:\n\nNetHunter \u2013 Needs rooted devices with custom recovery and patched kernel. Has no restrictions. Device specific images are available here.\nNetHunter Light \u2013 Needs rooted devices with custom recovery but no custom kernel. Has minor restrictions, i.e. no WiFi injection or HID support. Architecture specific images are available here.\nNetHunter Rootless \u2013 Installable on all stock standard, unmodified devices using Termux. Some limitations, like lack of db support in Metasploit and no root permissions. Installation instruction is available here.\nThe NetHunter documentation page includes a more detailed comparison.\nEach NetHunter edition comes with both the new \u201ckali\u201d user as well as root. KeX now supports multiple sessions so you can opt to run your pentest in one whilst writing a report in another.\n\nPlease note that due to how Samsung Galaxy devices function, the non-root user might not be able to run sudo but has to use su -c instead.\n\nOne of the peculiarities of the new \u201cNetHunter Rootless\u201d edition is that the default non-root user has almost full privileges in the chroot due to how proot containers work.\n\nKali Nethunter Kex Manager\n\nTheming\nWith our last release, we made a major change switching from GNOME to Xfce. That wasn\u2019t the end for us; we have kept on going with the design work, and have more updates:\n\nGNOME There is now a new theme for GNOME users and as an additional bonus, there is a light and dark theme!\n\nShell Overview\n\nLight Theme\n\nDark Theme\n\nTools We are giving the tools that you are very fond of a makeover too! We are slowly working through our collection, refreshing them and adding in new icons.\n\nKali Tools Icons\n\nMenu Eagle-eyed users may also notice the icons used in the menu have also been replaced.\n\nKali Menu\n\nSetup And if you opt to use the graphical installer of Kali, it\u2019s also been updated (Before and after shots)\n\nKali Setup Options\n\nKali-Undercover\nWe were not expecting the community\u2019s overwhelming response to kali-undercover. So carrying on from Kali 2019.4 release, Kali-undercover now starts to feel even more like Windows to help blend in.\n\nKali Undercover\n\nNew Packages\nKali Linux is a rolling distribution, so it gets updates as soon as they are available, rather than waiting for \u201cthe next release\u201d. So since the last release, we have the normal tool upgrades as well as a few new tools added, such as: cloud-enum, emailharvester, phpggc, sherlock, splinter.\n\nWe have a few new (kali-community-wallpapers) and old (kali-legacy-wallpapers) wallpapers to offer up if you want to customize or are feeling a little a little nostalgic.\n\nPython 2 End Of Life\nAs a reminder, Python 2 has reached \u201cend of life\u201d on the 1st of January 2020. What this means is, we are removing tools that depend on Python 2. Why? Because they are no longer being maintained, they are not receiving updates, and they need replacing. The pentesting landscape is a dynamic field that is forever changing. It\u2019s time to keep up. We will be doing our best to find alternatives that are actively worked upon.\n\nGiving A Helping Hand\nIf you want to contribute to Kali please do! If you have an area, idea of something YOU would like to work on, please dig in. If you want to help, but don\u2019t know where to start, please see our docs page. If you have a suggestion for a feature, please record it on the bug tracker.\n\nNote: the bug tracker is for bugs & suggestions. Its not a place to get help or support \u2013 that\u2019s for the forums.\n\nDownload Kali Linux 2020.1\nFresh images Why are you waiting? Start downloading now!\n\nExisting Upgrades If you already have an existing Kali installation, remember you can always do a quick update:\n\nkali@kali:~$ cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list\ndeb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib\nEOF\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt -y full-upgrade\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] && sudo reboot -f\nkali@kali:~$\nYou should now be on Kali Linux 2020.1.

ZSH. Is. Now. Default.\nBash shell makeover \u2013 It may not function like ZSH, but now Bash looks like ZSH.\nPartnership with tools authors \u2013 We are teaming up with byt3bl33d3r.\nMessage at login \u2013 Proactively pointing users to resources.\nAWS image refresh \u2013 Now on GovCloud. Includes Kali\u2019s default (command line) tools again. And there is a new URL.\nPackaging Guides \u2013 Want to start getting your tool inside of Kali? This should help.\nNew Tools & Updates \u2013 New Kernel and various new tools and updates for existing ones, as well as setting Proxychains 4 as default.\nNetHunter Updates \u2013 New NetHunter settings menu, select from different boot animations, and persistent Magisk.\nWin-KeX 2.5 \u2013 New \u201cEnhanced Session Mode\u201d brings Win-KeX to ARM devices\nVagrant & VMware \u2013 We now support VMware users who use Vagrant.\nZSH Shell By Default\nIn our previous quarterly release, 2020.3, we gave a heads up that we will be switching from Bash to ZSH as our default shell going forwards (where possible). We are happy to announce that after testing and feedback from users, the switch has now happened. Say hello to ZSH.\n\n\u250c\u2500\u2500(kali\u327fkali)-[~]\n\u2514\u2500$ echo Hello World. I'm $0\nHello World. I'm zsh\n\n\u250c\u2500\u2500(kali\u327fkali)-[~]\n\u2514\u2500$\nThank you to everyone who provided positive and constructive feedback. We are happy with it, and hope you are too. With that said, we know we cannot please everyone with it (so if you wish to revert back to Bash, please do: chsh -s /bin/bash).\n\nZSH will be the default shell on our desktop images (amd64/i386), and cloud. For the time being, other platforms (e.g. ARM, containers, NetHunter, WSL) will still use Bash. We hope to switch more over in later versions. If you use adduser, regardless of the platform, it will also default to Bash for the time being (to avoid some edge cases of items breaking). In time, this will be changed as well.\n\nHow do I get it? Good question! If you:\n\nDo a fresh install of Kali Linux 2020.4 or later, it will \u201cjust happen\u201d during the setup.\nIf you are updating Kali, you will need to switch each user to ZSH (e.g. non-root & root since Kali Linux does not use the root account since 2020.1).\nI need to switch. How do I? This can be done by applying our default zshrc file. If you are not already using ZSH, you can simply copy it over. If you are, you will need to overwrite (make sure to backup first).\n\nkali@kali:~$ [ -e ~/.zshrc ] && cp -i .zshrc{,.bak}\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ cp -i /etc/skel/.zshrc ~/\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ chsh -s /bin/zsh\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ zsh\nIf you\u2019re reading this, you may also be the type of person who likes Easter eggs \u2013 our prompts contain a few! If you go looking you may find a few gems (e.g. new_line_before_prompt & root vs non-root)._\n\nBash Shell Makeover\nKali Linux now has a universal, cross-shell theme.\n\nWhilst we were tweaking ZSH, we also updated our Bash prompt ($PS1), to make it feel similar (but not act similar) to our ZSH prompt. We started playing with the Bash prompt in Kali Linux 2020.3, when the colors changed for non-root users, from red to blue. Before then, we had not changed it since Kali Linux was first released.\n\n\n\nHow do I get it? Another good question! Very similar answer to ZSH, but this time using .bashrc instead. If you are doing:\n\nA fresh installation of Kali Linux 2020.4 or later, it\u2019s already applied.\nIf you are updating Kali, you will need to configure each user (e.g. non-root & root)\nIf you have made any alterations to ~/.bashrc, make sure to back it up before replacing it.\n\nkali@kali:~$ cp -i .bashrc{,.bak}\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ cp -i /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ source ~/.bashrc\n\u250c\u2500\u2500(kali\u327fkali)-[~]\n\u2514\u2500$ echo Hello World. I'm $0\nHello World. I'm bash\n\u250c\u2500\u2500(kali\u327fkali)-[~]\n\u2514\u2500$\nIf you look & edit the contents of .bashrc, you can switch to the red \u201cBackTrack-Linux\u201d prompt to be nostalgic.\n\nPartnership with tools authors: byt3bl33d3r\u2019s CrackMapExec (CME)\nKali Linux is part of the greater community and we want to support tool authors where possible. If you have not heard of CrackMapExec (a.k.a CME), you may be missing a trick (or three) when it comes to doing infrastructure assessments (especially involving Active Directory).\n\nWe noticed that byt3bl33d3r made the decision to move to a sponsorware model. You may or may not agree with his decision, but we understand his reasoning. The tools which he makes are highly valuable and relied upon by many. We want to support him and our Kali Linux users. After various calls and email exchanges, we are delighted to reveal Kali has partnered with byt3bl33d3r.\n\nWhat does this mean for me? The Kali package of CME is now pulling from a private source, allowing Kali Linux users to get access to the newest changes in CME 30 days before the tool is made public to everyone else. If you don\u2019t use Kali, you either need to sponsor directly or wait for it to be released after 30 days.\n\nWhy are you doing this? Because we believe in open source and the community as a whole. This way, everyone benefits; both authors and users.\n\nKali is open source. What is stopping me from stealing/ripping/cloning from you? The code will be distributed with a banner saying something along the lines of, \u201cfor Kali users only\u201d. Removing/altering the code will break the software license thus breaking copyright law. Do not be that guy.\n\nIs that it? Yes! Kali Linux is open source. We understand and respect software licenses, and by doing so we hope to keep everything open source as much as possible. Putting checks & protection in place, you may be happy using someone else\u2019s cracked/pirated software (warez) \u2013 but do you know what has been altered under the hood?\n\nBut Kali Linux being open source, has to respect other people license agreements, as do any other respectable organizations. This also includes when tools which have their license agreements changed in software updates, as a result, we have removed them from Kali.\n\nWe have more to announce about direction step in a 2021.x release (as well as looking for other authors to sponsor with). Stay tuned for more information!\n\nMessage At Login\nWe have noticed there being a large uprise of the amount of people saying \u201cKali Linux is missing \u2018XYZ'\u201d or \u201cXYZ feature is broken\u201d, when this is not always the case. We have done our best to write up various issues on our docs pages, however it appears they are not always being read. We also know that not everyone has a unix beard as long as @elwood-offsec, but hope you still are an experienced Linux user. There is always a reason why something is the way it is, but it may require more than the usual basic troubleshooting.\n\nWith all of that said, we are wanting to improve our communications going forwards. Most of the actions in Kali are done by the command line. So now, upon logging into a Kali terminal or console, you may be presented with a mixture of the following (depending on the configuration of your system, as it is dynamic):\n\n% ssh kali@172.16.13.37\nLast login: Thu Nov 12 15:12:29 2020 from 172.16.13.1\n\u250f\u2501(Message from Kali developers)\n\u2503\n\u2503 This is a minimal installation of Kali Linux, you likely\n\u2503 want to install supplementary tools.

Each of the issues have a link to our documentation page in order to correct the issue. After its been addressed, the message should not be displayed again. For whatever reason (unable or do not want to), you can permanently hide any messages from us being displayed by doing: touch ~/.hushlogin (per user) or touch /etc/kali-motd/disable-all (for a global setting).\n\nWe have a few other things in the works to help communicate items out planned for 2021.x. Stay tuned!\n\nAWS EC2 Cloud Image Refresh\nKali Linux has been on AWS since 1.0.6. Over the years, we have done various refreshes of our build-scripts to produce the cloud images. Finally with Kali 2020.2, we have a fully automated system in place. However during the changeover, we were shipping the image without any GUI or any tools by default. This was to give the cleanest, smallest image as possible. In hindsight, we didn\u2019t communicate this change over well, and a lot of you noticed \u201ctools missing\u201d (as kali-linux-default was not included). However, in 2020.4, we have created a new metapackage, kali-linux-headless, and included it which only has the default set of command line tools.\n\nUpon doing the refresh, we have worked with AWS to get Kali Linux added to \u201cGovCloud\u201c. Which may be useful to a certain audience. With how the accounts were setup, we have had to start from fresh. As a result, we have a new marketplace entry.\n\nWhat does this mean for people who are using the old entry? As Kali Linux is a rolling distribution, not a lot! You can still keep updating Kali Linux as usual. However, you will no longer be able to spin up the latest version using the latest instance. For that, you will need to switch to the new entry.\n\nNote: We have tried to say it as many different places as possible, but putting it here is not going to hurt. The default login for AWS EC2 username is \u201ckali\u201d (not the standard \u201cec2-user\u201d).\n\nKali Docs & Packaging Guides\nIn 2019.4, we moved https://docs.kali.org/ from a WordPress solution to https://www.kali.org/docs/ using Hugo. In September, we finished (for now) tweaking the theme, making it easier to use, super fast at loading and easier to anyone to edit.\n\nWe have started to go though all the pages and refreshing them, bringing them all up-to-date, and adding more in. We are doing it section by section, and so far have completed the first three (so we still have a way to go! After it is completed, it will be easier to keep them up-to-date, making it an on-going task. For the sections that are missing or lacking content, we have been generating issues to help track. If you want to help get involved with Kali Linux, this is an easy place to start.\n\nWe have also created various new pages, all about our packaging process:\n\nSetting Up A System For Packaging\nIntroduction to Packaging (Instaloader\u200b)\nIntermediate Packaging (Photon)\nAdvanced Packaging (FinalRecon & Python-icmplib)\nWe have also the pages from our login messages:\n\nCommon Cloud Based Setup Information\nEverything you need to know about the switch to Python 3\nMinimum Install Setup Information\nAnd various other pages created:\n\nAWS\nKali inside VirtualBox (Guest VM)\nUsing EoL Python Versions on Kali\nWin-KeX v2\nWin-KeX SL\nWin-KeX Win\nNew Tools & Updates\nAs with every Kali release, there are new tools and updates. The kernel got an upgrade to 5.9, so you benefit with all the loveliness that that brings. We have switched to \u201cproxychains4\u201d (aka ProxyChains-NG) as the default (everything from v3 should still work: same flags and configuration files & folder locations for legacy users, else the paths will reflect the version if starting from fresh). Also, GNOME was updated to 3.38 & KDE to 5.19.\n\nNew tools in Kali Linux:\n\nApple bleee\nCertGraph\ndnscat2\nFinalRecon\ngoDoH\nhostapd-mana\nMetasploit Framework v6\nWhatmask\nOne last thing. We have tweaked how we handle our wallpaper packages:\n\nkali-wallpapers-all ~ Give me all the wallpapers\nkali-wallpapers-2019.4 ~ Default for Kali Linux between 2019.4 and 2020.3\nkali-wallpapers-2020.4 ~ Default for Kali Linux between 2020.4 and onwards\nkali-wallpapers-legacy ~ Nostalgic value\nKali NetHunter\n@yesimxev has added a new settings menu, allowing for easy back up and restore of configuration files. It also allows you to change the Kali NetHunter boot animation. How is this as a teaser?\n\n\n\nCall on all boot animation devs out there: We\u2019d love to hear from you. If you have a cool boot animation you\u2019d like to share, please submit a merge request to our Kali NetHunter boot animation repository .\n\nThe new images also contain a \u201cMagisk persistence\u201d module, so we no longer have to flash Magisk again after we installed Kali NetHunter.\n\nWin-KeX 2.5\nWin-KeX 2.5 includes a new \u201cEnhanced Session Mode (\u2013esm)\u201d, which works like the \u201cWindow\u201d mode but uses the Remote Deskop Protocol (RDP) & client native to Windows. This mode will allow users of \u201cWindows on ARM\u201d devices to use Win-KeX and it adds sharpness to Win-KeX on HiDPI devices.\n\nWe have also added a \u201c\u2013ip\u201d option to address a bug in WoA causing massive packet losses when using \u201clocalhost\u201d. To start Win-KeX with sound on arm devices, just type:\n\nkali@kali:~$ kex --esm --ip --sound\nThe \u201c\u2013ip\u201d parameter has one little downside though: Win-KeX asks for the Kali Linux user password when launched for the first time and stores it in the Windows credentials store. Since the IP address changes after every reboot, you will be prompted again. This is a known WSL2 bug and we\u2019ll expect it to be fixed soon so that we can drop the \u201c\u2013ip\u201d parameter and we\u2019ll never have to enter the password again.\n\n\n\nKali Vagrant & VMware\nWe have had a Vagrant image since Kali Linux 2018.3. However, it\u2019s always been for VirtualBox. Until now. We are now also producing a VMware Vagrant image!\n\nNote, you will need to have a separate license for both VMware and Vagrant for this to work, as it is a paid-for plugin.\nFor more information, you can see here and here.\n\nKali ARM devices\nWe have been working away on our ARM images as usual, and this release is no exception. We have reduced the amount of pre-generated images (now 14) as there has not been the demand for these other devices. We have left their build scripts (now up to 43 devices supported), in case you wish to generate the images yourself.\n\nCommunity Shoutouts\nFollowing on from last time, these are people from the public who have helped Kali and the team for the last release. We are super grateful and want to praise them for their work (giving credit where due!):\n\n@1y for generating a ARM build script for a new device, imx6-ull-evk\n@dracode for the awesome work on Nethunter, in particular the GPS fixes.\n@mirivan for all the amazing additions and fixes to NetHunter as well as helping out with the issue tracker.\n@TheMMcOfficial for his continued help with NetHunter and DuckHunter\n@Martinvlba for his great contributions to NetHunter, especially hostapd\n@s133py for all the tireless work on NetHunter and helping with issues\nNot a community member per se, but we do want to give an honorable mention to GitLab. Kali Linux is now a Open-Source Partner (different to their Open-Source Program). We made the switch middle of 2019, and we could not have been happier. Thank you GitLab for supporting us, and for everything you do for the open-source communities as a whole!\n\n\n\nAnd on the subject, Kali Linux is apart of Docker\u2019s Open Source Community.\n\nDownload Kali Linux 2020.4\nFresh Images: So what are you waiting for? Start downloading already!\n\nSeasoned Kali Linux users are already aware of this, but for the ones who are not, we do also produce weekly builds that you can use as well. If you cannot wait for our next release and you want the latest packages when you download the image, you can just use the weekly image instead. This way you\u2019ll have fewer updates to do. Just know that these are automated builds that we do not QA like we do our standard release images. But we gladly take bug reports about those images because we want any issues to be fixed before our next release.\n\nExisting Upgrades: If you already have an existing Kali Linux installation, remember you can always do a quick update, followed by setting the default shell to ZSH. If you\u2019re already using ZSH, and want our new configuration, you can do the following:\n\nkali@kali:~$ echo \"deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt -y full-upgrade\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ cp -i /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ cp -i /etc/skel/.zshrc ~/\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ chsh -s /bin/zsh\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] && sudo reboot -f\nkali@kali:~$\nYou should now be on Kali Linux 2020.4. We can do a quick check by doing:\n\nkali@kali:~$ grep VERSION /etc/os-release\nVERSION=\"2020.4\"\nVERSION_ID=\"2020.4\"\nVERSION_CODENAME=\"kali-rolling\"\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ uname -v\n#1 SMP Debian 5.9.1-1kali2 (2020-10-29)\nkali@kali:~$\nkali@kali:~$ uname -r\n5.9.0-kali1-amd64\nkali@kali:~$\nNOTE: The output of uname -r may be different depending on the system architecture.\n\nAs always, should you come across any bugs in Kali, please submit a report on our bug tracker. We\u2019ll never be able to fix what we do not know is broken! And Twitter is not a Bug Tracker!\n\n\nWin-KeX Version 2.0\nSeptember 18, 2020\nre4son\nKali Linux News\nWe have been humbled by the amazing response to our recent launch of Win-KeX. After its initial release, we asked ourselves if that is truly the limit of what we can achieve or could we pull off something incredible to mark the 25th anniversary of Hackers? What about \u201ca second concurrent session as root\u201d, \u201cseamless desktop integration with Windows\u201d, or \u2013 dare we dream \u2013 \u201csound\u201d?\n\nWith no further further ado, we are thrilled to present to you Win-KeX v2.0 with the following features:\n\nWin-KeX SL (Seamless Edition) \u2013 bye bye borders\nSound support\nMulti-session support\nKeX sessions can be run as root\nAble to launch \u201ckex\u201d from anywhere \u2013 no more cd-ing into the Kali filesystem required\nShared clipboard \u2013 cut and paste content between Kali and Windows apps\niWin-KeX v2.0\n\nThe installation of Win-KeX is as easy as always:\n\nsudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install -y kali-win-kex (in a Kali WSL installation)\n\nWin-KeX now supports two dedicated modes:\n\nWin-KeX Window mode is the classic Win-KeX look and feel with one dedicated window for the Kali Linux desktop. To launch Win-KeX in Window mode with sound support, type:\nkex --win -s\nWin-KeX SL mode provides a seamless integration of Kali Linux into the Windows desktop with the Windows Start menu at the bottom and the Kali panel at the top of the screen. All applications are launched in their own windows sharing the same desktop as Windows applications.\nkex --sl --s\nTo enable sound:\nStart Win-KeX with the --sound or -s command line parameter. We\u2019ve been watching Blu-rays in Win-KeX SL without problems. Why you ask? Because \u2013 now we can ;-)\n\nWin-KeX now supports concurrent sessions\nWin-KeX as unprivileged user\nWin-KeX as root user\nWin-KeX SL\nWindows Firewall\nBoth SL mode and sound support require access through the Windows Defender firewall. When prompted, tick \u201cPublic networks\u201d. You can later go to the firewall settings and restrict the scope to the WSL network (usually 172.3x.xxx.0/20)\n\nManpage\nForgotten that lifesaving parameter? Try:\n\nkex --help\nfor a quick overview, or consult the manual page for a detailed manual:\n\nman kex\nWin-KeX Manpage\n\nBig shout-out to the authors of the following components without which there would be no Win-KeX:\nWin-KeX Win is brought to you by TigerVNC\nWin-KeX SL utilizes VcXsr Windows X Server\nSound support is achieved through the integration of PulseAudio.\nFurther Information:\nMore information can be found on our documentation site.\n\nWe hope you enjoy Win-KeX as much as we do and we\u2019d love to see you around in the Kali Forums\n\n"}
